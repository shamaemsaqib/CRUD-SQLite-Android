# CRUD-SQLite-Android


Designed an android mobile application with the following features:

## 1.Main Activity: 
  First screen contains 4 round buttons for 5 SQLite database operations i.e. adding new record, displaying all records, updating a record, deleting a record, and searching a record. Created separate activities for each option.
  
## 2. Inserting a New Record: 
  If user selects this option, an interface, where user can enter a record and it should be saved in SQLite database, starts. I have used Employee Object which stores the informaiton of an Employee.

## 3. Displaying All Record:
  If user selects this option, an interface where all stored records are displayed on a well design ListView, starts.

## 4. Update A Record: 
  If user selects this option, an interface pops up which displays all the records in a well designed ListView and if user clicks on a record another screen pop ups which takes the updated information and then updates the database.
  
## 5. Delete A Record:
  If user selects this option, an interface pops up which displays all the records in a well designed ListView and if user clicks on a record another screen pop ups which confirms either user want to delete this record or not and if user allows it deletes the record from the database.
  
## 6. Search A Record: 
  If user selects this option, an interface pops up where a user can input the name of employee to search for his/her record.
